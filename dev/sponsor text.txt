Do you own or manage a business and want your logo on this page? Any potential sponsor is invited to contact our public relations manager, Zac de Silva, on (+61) 0498 115 422.

We can fascilitate brand awareness of sponsors in the following ways:
- Logo easily visible on the sides of the robot for at least one year following the next kickoff. The robot is present at local fundraisers, as well as national competitions possibly watched by thousands of spectators.
- Branded t-shirts, hats, badges etc. worn at these events and on other occasions.
- Possible mention in newspapers, on radio broadcasts, television and suffixing team introduction by MC at competitions.

There is something we need in return though. The competition we compete in isn't cheap, and the kit of parts plus entry is $8500. We need some significant funding to enter this. We often showcase our robot at fairs and other such events, but this isn't enough to raise the money required.
