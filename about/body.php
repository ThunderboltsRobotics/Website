	Welcome to the future &mdash; the future where society is built upon science, data and currency are interchangable, and robots have enslaved mankind. Maybe not that last one.<br>
	As a self-managed team, we engage our minds with other enlightened youth in various ways, including competing in the <abbr title="For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology">FIRST</abbr><sup>&reg;</sup> Robotics Challenge and FIRST<sup>&reg;</sup> Tech Challenge, to advance the creativity and outreach of technology, and also to encourage the next generation to transcend the boundaries of today.
